      "question": "What are the three irreducible poles of reality that emerge from the primary act of abstraction?",
      "correct_answer": "The Observed (phenomena on this side of the boundary), The Observer (the position of subjectivity), and The Non-observed or Nothing (the fundamental background from which the boundary is drawn).",

      "id": 2,
      "question": "According to the lesson, what is the deontological imperative and why does it emerge evolutionarily?",
      "correct_answer": "The deontological imperative is the prohibition on initiating violence or violating another's boundary of subjectivity. It emerges because systematic violence leads to evolutionary dead ends, while cooperation enables sustainable development and survival of complex systems.",

      "question": "What is Level 6 of civilization according to the quantum levels described in the lesson?",
      "correct_answer": "Civil Society, where the boundary becomes universal and virtual, recognized around any individual who accepts the rule of mutual non-aggression, creating individual legal contours respected by all.",

      "question": "How do the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse represent systemic boundary violations in modern civilization, and what distinguishes pseudo-institutions from legitimate ones?",
      "correct_answer": "The Four Horsemen represent: erasure of local boundaries (White), internal societal war (Red), violation of just distribution boundaries (Black), and destruction of ecological equilibrium boundaries (Pale). Pseudo-institutions like fiat money formally exist within law but systematically violate boundaries of property and responsibility through hidden means.",

      "id": 5,
      "question": "What does the lesson identify as the primary task of philosophy today?",
      "correct_answer": "The critique of boundaries - diagnosing which boundaries extend recognition and cooperation versus those that represent regression to violence and exclusion, ensuring the act of distinction doesn't turn against the universal project.",
