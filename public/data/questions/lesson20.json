      "question": "What are the three irreducible poles of reality that emerge from the first act of abstraction?",
      "correct_answer": "The Observed (phenomena on this side of the boundary), the Observer (the position of subjectivity), and the Non-observed/Nothing (the fundamental background from which the boundary is drawn).",

      "id": 2,
      "question": "According to the lesson, what is the deontological imperative and why does it emerge from evolutionary logic?",
      "correct_answer": "The deontological imperative is the prohibition on initiating violence or violating another's boundary of subjectivity. It emerges because systematic violence leads to dead ends, while sustainable group development requires cooperation over suppression.",

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What is the highest quantum level of civilization described in the lesson, and how does it define boundaries?",
      "correct_answer": "Civil Society (Level 6), which creates universal and virtual boundaries recognized around any individual who accepts the rule of mutual non-aggression, making boundaries individual legal contours rather than collective barriers.",

      "id": 4,
      "question": "How do the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse represent systemic boundary violations in modern civilization, and what is the philosophical significance of this interpretation?",
      "correct_answer": "Each horseman represents destruction of different systemic boundaries: White (local boundaries), Red (internal social boundaries), Black (just distribution boundaries), and Pale (ecological boundaries). This shows how civilization's complexity creates immanent diseases that can destroy the boundary-recognition system that created it.",

    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "What distinguishes legitimate institutions from pseudo-institutions according to the lesson?",
      "correct_answer": "Legitimate institutions crystallize proper boundaries and operate within legal frameworks, while pseudo-institutions systematically violate boundaries under the guise of technical necessity (like fiat money causing inflation or bailouts erasing risk-responsibility boundaries).",
