      "question": "According to the radio receiver model, what role does our 'I' play in the thinking process?",
      "correct_answer": "Our 'I' is not the author of thoughts but their radio receiver - we catch thoughts rather than compose them.",

      "question": "What is memory described as in this theory?",
      "correct_answer": "Memory is not a warehouse of pictures but preserved patterns of frequencies that we tune into through resonance.",

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What does it mean 'to remember' according to the resonance model?",
      "correct_answer": "To remember means to tune your heterodyne to the frequency of the preserved pattern and obtain resonance.",

      "id": 4,
      "question": "What are the four key abilities that should be developed to teach thinking effectively?",
      "correct_answer": "The ability to distinguish (find differences), compare (find similarities and differences), abstract (move from specific to general), and create conditions for resonance (ask the right questions).",

      "id": 5,
      "question": "What happens when a child arrives at the formulation of the Pythagorean theorem themselves?",
      "correct_answer": "Cognitive resonance occurs in their brain - they cry 'Wow!' and will think with pleasure because the knowledge becomes truly their own.",
