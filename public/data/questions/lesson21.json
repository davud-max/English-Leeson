      "question": "What is the difference between seeing and observing according to this lecture?",
      "correct_answer": "An animal sees but does not observe. Only humans observe. Observation is the artificial separation of a part from unified existence - it requires conscious distinction.",

    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What is a definition and how does it differ from a regular description?",
      "correct_answer": "A definition is the shortest description of what is observed. While ten people may give different descriptions, the shortest description will be identical for everyone.",
      "difficulty": "easy",

    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What are fundamental terms and why is 'point' considered one?",
      "correct_answer": "Fundamental terms have no definitions - they are ultimate concepts that exist only in the mind as pure abstraction. A point is fundamental because it is zero-dimensional and cannot be defined further. A pencil mark on paper is not a point but a spot.",

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between a name and a term.",
      "correct_answer": "A name is a word for a real object - it can be shown but cannot be described completely because real objects have infinite details. A term is a word for an abstract object - it cannot be shown but can be described completely and definitively.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "points": 15
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Why can't you visualize the number five itself?",
      "correct_answer": "The number five is a pure abstraction - it's impossible to visualize. When you try, you either imagine five objects (a group) or the symbol '5' (a digit), but not the number itself. Numbers exist only as abstract concepts.",
