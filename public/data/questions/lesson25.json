      "correct_answer": "The analog circuit (immediate, embodied, sensory experience) and the digital circuit (abstractions, signs, and concepts).",

      "question": "In the radio analogy, what does 'resonance' represent in the thinking process?",
      "correct_answer": "The moment when a thought's frequency matches our local oscillator, allowing us to 'catch' or become aware of that thought.",

      "question": "How does thinking as resonance challenge the traditional approach to education, and what alternative method does the lesson propose?",
      "correct_answer": "Traditional rote learning loads empty symbols without experience, preventing resonance. The effective approach is learning through experience first, then providing abstract labels at peak experience moments to create resonance.",

      "question": "What are the three factors that tune our 'analog core' or cognitive profile?",
      "correct_answer": "Heredity (factory settings), cultural code (language, values, concepts of society), and personal experience (the most important factor).",

      "question": "Analyze the philosophical interpretation of 'light' in the Genesis creation story presented in the lesson. What does this light represent and why is it significant for human consciousness?",
      "correct_answer": "Light represents the ability to abstract and observe - the capacity to distinguish boundaries between the observable (World) and unobservable (Nothingness). It's what allows humans to look from outside and observe, unlike animals who merely react to physical light.",
