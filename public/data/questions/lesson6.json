    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the difference between an unconditioned stimulus and a conditioned stimulus?",
      "correct_answer": "An unconditioned stimulus naturally produces a response (like food causing salivation), while a conditioned stimulus is a neutral stimulus that learns to trigger the same response through repeated pairing with the unconditioned stimulus.",

    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "In Pavlov's experiment, what happened when the bell was rung repeatedly without presenting food?",
      "correct_answer": "The bell became a conditioned stimulus that triggered salivation even without the presence of food.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "points": 5
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "How does understanding conditional reflexes create a bridge between mechanical behavior and conscious development?",
      "correct_answer": "Awareness of our conditioning mechanisms reveals the boundaries of free will and creates space for genuine choice, allowing us to potentially recondition ourselves deliberately rather than being purely reactive.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "points": 15
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "According to the lesson, what role do conditioning processes play in human emotions, preferences, and habits?",
      "correct_answer": "Much of what we consider conscious choice, including our emotional reactions, preferences, and habits, are actually conditioned responses formed through similar conditioning processes as Pavlov's reflexes.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "points": 5
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Analyze the paradox presented in the lesson regarding awareness of conditioning and free will. How does knowledge of our mechanical nature potentially enhance rather than diminish human agency?",
      "correct_answer": "While understanding conditioning reveals that much of our behavior is mechanical rather than freely chosen, this awareness creates the possibility for deliberate reconditioning. Knowledge of our conditioning mechanisms provides the foundation for conscious choice by revealing where genuine agency can be exercised.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
