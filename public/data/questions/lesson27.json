      "question": "What is Minus-space and how does it differ from ordinary space and points?",
      "correct_answer": "Minus-space is that which possesses neither extension nor position. It is the absence of the container itself, the cancellation of distinguishing between 'here' and 'there,' unlike space (which has extension) and points (which have position but not extension).",

      "question": "Explain the Biblical narrative of creation as interpreted through the theory of abstraction, including the symbolic meaning of Water, Light, firmament, and Man.",
      "correct_answer": "Water represents primordial Being (indistinguishable unity), Light is the capacity to abstract (gift of discernment), the firmament is the boundary between World and Nothingness, and Man is the observer born from water through light - representing the awakening of human consciousness.",
