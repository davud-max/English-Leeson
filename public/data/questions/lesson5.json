      "question": "What is the difference between a number and a numeral?",
      "correct_answer": "A number is a pure abstraction that exists only as a concept, while a numeral is the term for a counting result.",

      "question": "Can you see or touch the number five itself?",
      "correct_answer": "No, you cannot see, touch, or show the number five itself. You can only show five objects, but not 'fiveness'.",

      "question": "Why did counting emerge?",

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Why is understanding numbers as pure abstractions essential for mathematics?",
      "correct_answer": "This abstraction enables mathematics because operations on numbers follow logical rules independent of what is being counted, which is essential for grasping higher mathematics and formal systems.",
