      "question": "Why is 666 described as a 'formula' rather than a single number?",

      "points": 15
    },

      "id": 5,
      "question": "What does the 'End of Light' mean in this interpretation?",
      "correct_answer": "The End of Light is not a catastrophe but the completion of its mission - when the goal of reaching the third six (divine level) is achieved, the need for distinction falls away.",
