      "question": "According to the radio analogy, what role does the 'self' play in the thinking process?",
      "correct_answer": "The 'self' is not the author of thoughts, but rather their radio receiver that captures thoughts through resonance.",

      "id": 2,
      "question": "What are the two main circuits of consciousness described in the lesson, and what is their primary difference?",
      "correct_answer": "The analog circuit handles direct, embodied experiences with small bandwidth but deep meaning, while the digital circuit processes abstractions and concepts with vast bandwidth but no inherent meaning.",

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Analyze how the three factors that tune our 'cognitive profile' interact to create individual differences in thinking patterns.",
      "correct_answer": "Heredity provides the basic neural framework, cultural code shapes our conceptual language and values, while personal experience fine-tunes the resonator through successes and failures, creating a unique filter for which thoughts resonate with each individual.",

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What does 'light' represent in the Genesis interpretation presented in the lesson?",
      "correct_answer": "'Light' represents the ability to abstract - the capacity to distinguish boundaries between the observable (World) and unobservable (Nothingness), which enables true observation rather than mere animal vision.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "points": 5
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Explain the paradox of God 'seeing' the light in Genesis and how this relates to the emergence of the observer (Man).",
      "correct_answer": "The paradox is that God, being absolute and omniscient, shouldn't need to 'see' or distinguish good from bad. This seeing represents the birth of the observer (Man) through light (abstraction ability), who can distinguish World from Nothingness by existing outside both.",
