In the Bible: 'And the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.' 'Dust of the ground' — this is still undifferentiated material of being. 'Breath of life' — this is that same light, the ability to distinguish, which makes man living consciousness.
