We began with something simple: 'Describe what you see.' And we encountered a paradox: to describe, you already need to know words. But words are terms, and terms are labels for definitions. We get a closed circle.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Only one thing can break it — the act of primary distinction. Even before words. Even before definitions.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Imagine absolute darkness. Not physical, but meaningful. There is no 'here' or 'there', no 'I' or 'not-I'. This is what ancient texts call 'water' — homogeneous, indistinguishable Being.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

What can happen in this 'water'? Only one thing — the appearance of a boundary. But for this, light is needed.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Light is not photons. It's the ability to draw a line and say: 'this is not that.'

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

In the Bible, this moment is described thus: 'And God said: let there be light. And there was light.' Notice: God didn't 'create' light in the usual sense. He named it. That is, light appears as an act of naming, as the first operation of distinction.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Light separated from darkness. What does this mean in our conceptual system? The observable separated from the unobservable. 'Earth' — World — separated from 'heaven' — Nothing. A firmament appeared — that very first boundary.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Let's recall our first lecture. What happened when we started describing a circle?

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Object — chalk mark on board — this is analogous to 'water', indistinguishable Being.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Observer — the child who looks — this is analogous to the Spirit that 'moves over the water.'

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Act of description — drawing boundaries: curved, closed, equidistant — this is the light itself.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Here are the three inseparable elements:

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Being — what is.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Consciousness — what distinguishes.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Act of distinction — light, giving birth to boundaries.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

In religious tradition, this is called Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. But in our system, this is not mysticism, but a strict scheme of cognition.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Father equals Being — the source material.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Son equals Logos, Word, act of distinction — light.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Holy Spirit equals Consciousness, spirit of the observer.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Pay attention: in our first lecture, a term was born only after definition. Here too: the world is born only after the act of distinction. God didn't 'create' the world like a carpenter creates a table. The world 'appeared' as a result of an Observer capable of distinguishing it appearing.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Here's the key point. If the world appears only when there is someone to distinguish it, then man is not a passive spectator. He is a co-creator.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

In the Bible: 'And the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.' 'Dust of the ground' — this is still undifferentiated material of being. 'Breath of life' — this is that same light, the ability to distinguish, which makes man living consciousness.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

The terrible meaning of the phrase becomes clear: 'And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.' This is not about the end of the planet. This is about a change in consciousness paradigm. When a person's way of distinguishing changes — 'new light' appears — for him the old world disappears and a new one appears.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

We live not in 'objective reality'. We live in reality distinguished by our consciousness.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Your table, your cup, your friend — all this is boundaries drawn by your light-consciousness in the indivisible fabric of Being. These boundaries are stable because our way of distinguishing — our 'metric', as physicists would say — is common to all people raised in the same culture.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

But imagine a creature with a different 'metric' — for example, a dolphin, a bat, or an alien. For them, the firmament passes in different places. Their 'earth' and their 'heaven' are different. They live in a different world, though the physical Being is one.

=== SLIDE BREAK ===

Exercise: Look at any object in the room. Try to stop recognizing it. Forget its name, function. Try to see in it simply 'a piece of distinguished Being'. This is an attempt to return to 'water' before the appearance of light. You will feel slight dizziness. This is the experience of dissolving boundaries.
