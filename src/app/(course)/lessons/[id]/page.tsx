How precise knowledge is born. How observation is transformed into a word, and a word into an instrument of thought.

## From Observation to Term

### Part 1. Observation and Description

Everything begins with observation. What is observed must be described in words in such a way that the listener understands precisely what has been observed.

The shortest possible description will be called a **definition**.

> **DEFINITION**  
> The shortest description of what is observed, sufficient for understanding by another person.

A **term** is assigned to a definition.

> **TERM**  
> A word assigned to a definition for ease of use.

Every term, except a fundamental term, has a definition.

A **fundamental term** is a term that has no definition.

---

### Part 2. Fundamental Terms

A **point** is a fundamental term. A point has no definition because it cannot be observed. It is zero-dimensional, or, as one says, has no measure or dimension.

> **POINT**  
> Fundamental term  
> 0 dimensions  
> Unobservable

A point drawn with chalk on a board or pencil on paper is not, in fact, a point, but a **spot**.

A **line** is a first-level fundamental term; that is, it is one-dimensional. It can be described using a point.

> **LINE**  
> Fundamental term  
> 1 dimension  
> A point extended

It is said that a line consists of a set of points. However, it is impossible to describe the order of these points without circularity, since one must say that the points are arranged along a line, which is incorrect.

---

### Part 3. Plane and Space

A **plane** is a second-level fundamental term; that is, it is two-dimensional.

> **PLANE**  
> Fundamental term  
> 2 dimensions  
> A line extended laterally

It is said that a plane consists of many parallel lines. A plane is unobservable, since the lines of which it consists are also unobservable.

**Space** is a third-level fundamental term; that is, it is three-dimensional.

> **SPACE**  
> Fundamental term  
> 3 dimensions  
> A plane extended laterally

Space is unobservable, since the planes of which it consists are also unobservable.

---

### Part 4. The Power of Fundamental Terms

These four fundamental terms allow us to construct descriptions and definitions of any abstract objects.

> **THE FOUR FUNDAMENTAL TERMS**  
> Point — 0 dimensions  
> Line — 1 dimension  
> Plane — 2 dimensions  
> Space — 3 dimensions

Since every abstract object is, in essence, nothing, it can be described by a finite number of fundamental terms.

> **KEY DISTINCTION**  
> An abstract object can be described completely and definitively.  
> A real object cannot.

A real object cannot be described by a finite number of named elements, since their number — down to the atomic level — is infinite.

---

### Part 5. Name and Term

Thus, every real object cannot be fully described, but it can be directly demonstrated and designated by a word.

> **NAME**  
> A word for a real object  
> Can be pointed to  
> Cannot be fully described

> **TERM**  
> A word for an abstract object  
> Cannot be pointed to  
> Can be fully described

An abstract object cannot be demonstrated. It does not exist. But it can be described using fundamental terms.

---

### Part 6. Two Opposing Movements

We have demonstrated the path by which an abstract object becomes a noun. But is the reverse path possible?

Can a noun become a term and thereby an abstraction?

**It can.**

#### The Path from Reality to Abstraction

For a child, the word "apple" initially refers only to **this particular red apple**.

If another apple is shown — for example, a green one — the child, comparing it with the first and noticing the difference, will not accept it as an apple. For the child, it is **not** an apple; it is something else.

Only over time, through experience and communication, does the child come to understand that there are many objects which, despite their differences, are still called apples.

#### The Birth of Abstraction

The child forms an image of "**apple in general**" — an abstraction. By comparing with this abstraction, the child recognizes an observed object as an apple, even if encountering that type of apple for the first time.

In this case, the word "apple" is no longer a name for the child, but a **term**.

---

## Lesson Summary

We have traced two opposing movements:

**From reality to abstraction**  
Observe → describe → define → assign a term

**From abstraction to reality**  
Take a term → search for corresponding objects in the world

> **THE ESSENCE OF EDUCATION**  
> The ability to move freely in both directions is what we must teach a child. The development of the capacity to translate reality into images (abstractions) and images back into reality.

This is the foundation of thinking: the ability to see the invisible behind the visible and to find visible embodiments of invisible ideas.`
